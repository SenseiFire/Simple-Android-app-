    <string name="textview"> The Origins of Myteen Corporation

The idea started by the year 2015 when news about unemployment had struck South Africa. I knew from that moment this is the era of start-ups and fin-tech businesses since we are all heading towards the fourth industrial revolution where technology penetrates every discipline and industry
The issue of the South African youth being unemployed has caused a concern about the future of the South African economy and I decided to name this fintech start-up Myteen Corporation since I have seen on Google about how the term Myteen is misused.

We at Myteen Corporation believe that the youth has the power in both creative and imaginative thinking.

Myteen Corporation aims to innovate the industry and to improve the economy of South Africa we aim on creating job opportunities for the youth of South Africa. We want to create a model that will give smart teenagers or varsity students an opportunity to generate income by having them participate in some of our products and services that we sell to our clients.
Myteen Corporation plans to be an industry Tech Giant born in South Africa that is competent globally with other tech Giants from the rest of the world. Myteen Corporation would like to one day reach technological innovation status such as those of space x, Tesla, Google and Apple.
Myteen Corporation is an IT solutions company that provides services such as Software development, mobile app development, software testing Unorthodox Prototype research feedback in line with Data Analytics.
